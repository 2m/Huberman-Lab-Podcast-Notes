Protocols for loosing weight faster:
* fidgeting, fast/abrupt movements make it easier to mobilize fat cells
* shivering induces generation of brown fat from white fat

Shivering training protocol:
* 3 times:
  * get under cold shover for up to minute/until shivering
  * get out of under cold water and let dry off
* it is important to not get cold adapted

Supplements:
* caffeine for epinephrine release (adrenaline is main actor in fat store)
* yerba mate for glp-1 pathway activation in brain
* acetylcarnitine increases fat oxidation
